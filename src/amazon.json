I'm going to throw in something random so you can get bored and stop reading. Are you ready? Here we go... My feet gallop along the race track, the ice frozen in my elbows. WOW. Do you see the sky? Its redder than a blueberry riding a giraffe. The jackrabbit tap dances half past pizza time. Snacks are really just a filler for pillows. I construct houses out of legs, but my fingernails ache still. The keyboard swims, gasping for air, it can only be pink though. OK... now you should be gone and if you arent, you win I give up.",
